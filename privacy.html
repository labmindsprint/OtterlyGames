      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 14, 2026 · <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 15, 2026</p>
      <p><strong>Otterly Games</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting the privacy of children and families who use our apps and website. This policy explains what information we collect (spoiler: almost nothing) and how we handle it.</p>

      <h2>1. Our Core Principle</h2>
      <p>We collect <strong>zero personal data</strong> from our users. No names, no emails, no phone numbers, no location data, no browsing history. Period.</p>

      <h2>2. Our Mobile Apps (Clock Master & Math Tank)</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Data We Collect: None</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Our apps do not require accounts or registration</li>
        <li>All game progress, settings, and customization data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> only</li>
        <li>We cannot access, view, or retrieve any data from your device</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Advertising</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Our apps use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements</li>
        <li>All ads are configured with <strong>child-directed treatment</strong> (tag_for_child_directed_treatment), which means Google does not serve personalized or interest-based ads</li>
        <li>AdMob may collect non-personal technical data (device type, OS version, app interactions) for ad serving and fraud prevention — this is handled entirely by Google and we do not have access to it</li>
        <li>Ads are clearly labeled and appear as either rewarded (user chooses to watch) or banner format</li>
        <li>We do not use any ad targeting based on personal information</li>
        <li>For details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9012903" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's Families Policy</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3 COPPA Compliance</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Our apps are <strong>COPPA compliant</strong> and are designed with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act in mind</li>
        <li>Our apps are designated as "Designed primarily for children" in the Google Play Console</li>
        <li>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or under any age)</li>
        <li>All advertising SDKs are configured for child-directed content</li>
        <li>Our Google Play Data Safety declarations reflect our actual data practices</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.4 Child Safety Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Our apps are designed for children aged 4-10</li>
        <li>Settings are protected by a <strong>parental gate</strong> (math problem verification) to prevent accidental changes</li>
        <li>No links to external websites from within the game experience</li>
        <li>No social features, chat, messaging, or user-generated content</li>
        <li>No ability to share personal information within the apps</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Our Website (otterlygames.com)</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Data We Collect</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Our website is a static site hosted on <strong>GitHub Pages</strong></li>
        <li>We do not use first-party cookies or tracking pixels</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics services (no Google Analytics, no Meta Pixel, etc.)</li>
        <li>We do not track individual users or build user profiles</li>
        <li>Our free learning tools (multiplication tables, math quizzes, spelling practice, etc.) run <strong>entirely in your browser</strong> with zero data sent to any server</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Embedded Game Demos</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Our homepage features playable demos of our games embedded via iframe</li>
        <li>These demos run locally in your browser and do not transmit any data</li>
        <li>No game progress or interaction data from demos is collected or stored by us</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.3 Third-Party Services on the Website</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> Our hosting provider. GitHub may collect standard server access logs (IP address, browser type, pages visited) as part of their hosting service. See <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub's Privacy Statement</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Fonts:</strong> We load fonts from Google Fonts, which may log requests. See <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Fonts Privacy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Ko-fi:</strong> Our optional support widget is provided by Ko-fi. If you choose to make a donation, Ko-fi's privacy policy applies. We do not receive personal information from Ko-fi beyond what is shown on their public platform.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Since we don't collect personal data, there is nothing to retain or delete. Game progress on our apps is stored locally on your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the app or clearing app data in your device settings.</p>

      <h2>5. International Users</h2>
      <p>Our apps and website are available globally. Regardless of where you are located, we apply the same privacy standards. We do not transfer personal data internationally because we do not collect personal data. For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we note that any non-personal data collected by third-party ad services (Google AdMob) is handled in accordance with Google's GDPR compliance measures.</p>

      <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Because we don't collect personal data, there is no data to access, correct, export, or delete. However, we respect your rights under applicable privacy laws (including GDPR, CCPA, and others). If you have any concerns, please contact us.</p>

      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Since all user data remains on your device, security is managed by your device's operating system. We do not operate servers that store user data. In the unlikely event that a third-party service we integrate with experiences a data breach, we will notify affected users as required by applicable law.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. For significant changes, we will make reasonable efforts to provide notice (such as a notice on our website).</p>

      <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
      <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, concerns about our data practices, or wish to exercise any privacy rights, please contact us:</p>
