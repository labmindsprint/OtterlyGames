    <div class="post-content">
      <p>It was a Tuesday evening. Homework time. My son stared at the analog clock on his worksheet with a look I knew all too well — a mix of confusion and frustration that was about to turn into tears.</p>

      <p>"Mama, I don't understand. Why does the little hand mean hours and the big hand means minutes? That doesn't make sense!"</p>

      <p>She had a point. To a 5-year-old, it really doesn't make intuitive sense. And honestly? In that moment, I struggled to explain it in a way that clicked. We'd been at it for 20 minutes, and we were both exhausted.</p>

      <h2>The Search for Help</h2>

      <p>That night, after she went to bed, I did what every modern parent does — I searched for an app. Surely, in 2025, there must be a great app that teaches kids to read clocks, right?</p>

      <p>What I found was... disappointing:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>App #1:</strong> Beautiful design, but wanted $9.99/month. For a clock app. For a five-year-old.</li>
        <li><strong>App #2:</strong> Free, but bombarded with full-screen ads every 30 seconds. My son clicked on three ads before I could take the phone back.</li>
        <li><strong>App #3:</strong> Actually decent content, but the UI was so dated it looked like it was built in 2010. My son refused to use it.</li>
        <li><strong>App #4:</strong> Required an account with email, birthday, and school name. Absolutely not.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Not a single app hit all three basics: <strong>free, safe, and actually fun</strong>.</p>

      <h2>The Ridiculous Idea</h2>

      <p>I'm not a developer. I'm a mom. But I had a background in product management and a stubbornness that my husband describes as "concerning." So I thought: <em>What if I just... build one?</em></p>

      <p>It started as a toy project — learn some React, make a simple clock with draggable hands, add some colorful buttons. Let my son test it.</p>

      <blockquote>"Mama, can I play the clock game again?" — my son, at breakfast, voluntarily asking to practice telling time.</blockquote>

      <p>That sentence changed everything. She wasn't asking to do homework. She was asking to <em>play</em>. The same child who cried over clock worksheets was now excited about telling time because it was wrapped in a game.</p>

      <h2>From Side Project to Clock Master</h2>

      <p>Over the next few months, the app grew. I added:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>8 structured lessons</strong> — from the hour hand all the way to time addition and subtraction</li>
        <li><strong>A racing game</strong> — answer clock questions to boost your car. My son's competitive streak kicked in.</li>
        <li><strong>Space exploration</strong> — fly a rocket through 30 real celestial objects by solving time problems. She now knows more about nebulae than I do.</li>
        <li><strong>Foxy</strong> — a fox mascot that guides first-time players through the app with voice narration. My son named her.</li>
        <li><strong>A parental gate</strong> — because I know what it's like to have a child accidentally change all the settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most importantly, I kept it <strong>honest and transparent</strong>. No subscriptions. No data collection. No accounts. No in-app purchases. Just clearly-labeled ads with child-directed settings. Everything I wished those other apps had done.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned Along the Way</h2>

      <p>Building Clock Master taught me something broader about how kids learn:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Context matters more than repetition.</strong> My son learned more from 10 minutes of the racing game than 30 minutes of worksheets. The clock questions weren't homework — they were fuel for his car.</li>
        <li><strong>Small wins build confidence.</strong> Earning coins, unlocking a new car color, getting a trophy — these tiny dopamine hits kept her coming back, and each one required correctly reading the time.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice guidance enables independence.</strong> Once I added text-to-speech, she could learn without me hovering. That was a game-changer for both of us.</li>
        <li><strong>Kids don't want "educational" — they want fun.</strong> If it's genuinely fun, the learning happens without resistance.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>And Then Came Math Tank</h2>

      <p>A few months later, multiplication tables entered our lives. Same struggle, same tears, same search for a good app. But this time, I didn't search. I built.</p>

      <p><a href="/apps/math-tank.html">Math Tank</a> took the same philosophy — learning disguised as play — and applied it to multiplication and division. Instead of a car race, it's tank battles. Instead of clock questions, it's times tables. Same Foxy guide. Same parental gate. Same commitment to free, safe, and fun.</p>

        <h4>🦦 The Otterly Games Philosophy</h4>
        <p>Every feature in our apps passes one test: "Would I want this for my own child?" If the answer is no, it doesn't ship. That's it. That's the strategy.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>What's Next</h2>

      <p>Otterly Games is just getting started. I'm one mom with a laptop, some AI tools, and a deep understanding of what parents actually need. If these games help even one other parent avoid a tearful homework session, it will all have been worth it.</p>

      <p>If you've found our apps helpful, I'd love to hear from you. And if you want to support this tiny operation, you can <a href="https://ko-fi.com/otterly_games"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy me a coffee on Ko-fi</a>. Every cup helps keep the lights on. ☕</p>
