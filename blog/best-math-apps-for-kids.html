  <article class="post-content">
    <p>As a parent who also builds educational apps, I have strong opinions about math apps. I've tested over 20 of them with my own kids, and I can tell you: most are either glorified flashcards, subscription traps, or ad-filled nightmares.</p>

    <p>But some are genuinely brilliant. Here are the math apps that actually deserve a spot on your child's device in 2025.</p>

    <h2>What Makes a Good Math App?</h2>

    <p>Before the list, here's my criteria. A good math app should:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Teach concepts, not just drill facts</strong> — understanding WHY 6×7=42 matters more than memorizing it</li>
      <li><strong>Be engaging without being addictive</strong> — fun mechanics, not dopamine manipulation</li>
      <li><strong>Respect children's privacy</strong> — minimal data collection, COPPA compliant</li>
      <li><strong>Have reasonable monetization</strong> — either free, one-time purchase, or affordable subscription</li>
      <li><strong>Adapt to the child's level</strong> — not too easy, not too hard</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Free Math Apps</h2>

    <h3>1. Math Tank: Learn × Battle (Otterly Games)</h3>
    <p><strong>Ages:</strong> 4-9 · <strong>Focus:</strong> Multiplication & Division · <strong>Platform:</strong> Android</p>
    <p>Full disclosure: this is our app. But here's why it belongs on this list — Math Tank turns multiplication and division into a space battle game. Kids fire missiles by solving math problems, unlock 10 unique weapons, and progress through 90 levels. It also includes 6 animated video lessons that explain concepts visually.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The game mechanic is tied directly to math. You can't progress without solving problems — but you WANT to progress because the gameplay is genuinely fun. Zero ads, zero data collection, completely free.</p>

    <h3>2. Khan Academy Kids</h3>
    <p><strong>Ages:</strong> 2-8 · <strong>Focus:</strong> All subjects · <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
    <p>The gold standard for free educational apps. Khan Academy Kids covers math, reading, and more with a beautiful interface and zero ads. The math section includes counting, addition, subtraction, and early geometry through interactive activities and stories.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> Completely free, no ads, no subscriptions. The content is curriculum-aligned and the adaptive learning path adjusts to each child. The only downside is that it can feel less "game-like" than some alternatives.</p>

    <h3>3. Prodigy Math</h3>
    <p><strong>Ages:</strong> 6-12 · <strong>Focus:</strong> Curriculum-aligned math · <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android, Web</p>
    <p>Prodigy wraps math practice in an RPG adventure. Kids create a wizard character and battle monsters by solving math problems. The free version covers the core gameplay; the paid version ($9.95/month) adds cosmetic extras.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The RPG format is insanely engaging. Kids forget they're doing math. The curriculum alignment means it complements what they learn at school. The nudge toward the paid version can be aggressive, though.</p>

    <h2>Best Paid Math Apps</h2>

    <h3>4. Moose Math (Duck Duck Moose)</h3>
    <p><strong>Ages:</strong> 3-7 · <strong>Focus:</strong> Counting, addition, geometry · <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
    <p>A beautifully designed app that teaches early math concepts through cooking, building, and driving activities. Each activity targets specific skills like counting, adding, subtracting, sorting, and recognizing shapes.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The activities feel like play, not work. The art style is charming, and the variety keeps kids engaged. One-time purchase — no subscriptions or ads.</p>

    <h3>5. Todo Math</h3>
    <p><strong>Ages:</strong> 3-8 · <strong>Focus:</strong> Comprehensive math · <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
    <p>Todo Math offers a structured 15-minute daily math practice with over 700 activities. It covers counting, arithmetic, logic, patterns, and basic geometry. The adaptive difficulty means it grows with your child.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> The "daily practice" structure builds consistency. The bite-sized sessions prevent burnout. Kids earn rewards for completing their daily goal, creating a healthy habit loop.</p>

    <h3>6. DragonBox Numbers</h3>
    <p><strong>Ages:</strong> 4-8 · <strong>Focus:</strong> Number sense · <strong>Platform:</strong> iOS, Android</p>
    <p>DragonBox takes a completely different approach: kids play with "Nooms" — cute characters that represent numbers. By combining, splitting, and comparing Nooms, children develop a deep intuitive understanding of what numbers actually ARE.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it works:</strong> It builds number sense — the foundation of all math — through play. No flashcards, no pressure. Kids who use DragonBox often develop a stronger conceptual understanding than those who just memorize facts.</p>

    <h2>Best for Specific Skills</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>

    <p>When evaluating math apps, avoid ones that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Show ads every 30 seconds</strong> — especially full-screen video ads. Kids tap on them accidentally and end up in the App Store</li>
      <li><strong>Require personal information</strong> — a math app has no business knowing your child's school name, birthday, or email</li>
      <li><strong>Gate basic content behind expensive subscriptions</strong> — if the free version is essentially a demo, it's a subscription trap</li>
      <li><strong>Reward watching ads</strong> — "Watch a video to earn coins" teaches kids to seek out advertising</li>
      <li><strong>Have purely cosmetic "math"</strong> — if the game works even when you answer wrong, it's not actually teaching</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

    <p>The best math app is the one your child will actually use. Try a few from this list, see which one clicks, and let them run with it. And remember: apps are a supplement, not a replacement. Real-world math — cooking, shopping, building — is still the most powerful teacher of all.</p>
